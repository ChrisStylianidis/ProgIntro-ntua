    2:   FIVE WEEKS IN A BALLOON
    3:   
    4:   CHAPTER FIRST.
    5:   
    6:   
    7:   THERE was a large audience assembled on the 14th of January, 1862, at the
    8:   session of the Royal Geographical Society, No. 3 Waterloo Place, London. The
    9:   president, Sir Francis M , made an important communication to his
   10:   colleagues, in an address that was frequently interrupted by applause.
   11:   
   12:   This rare specimen of eloquence terminated with the following sonorous
   13:   phrases bubbling over with patriotism :
   14:   
   15:   'England has always marched at the head of nations' (for, the reader will
   16:   observe, the nations always march at the head of each other), 'by the
   17:   intrepidity of her explorers in the line of geographical discovery.'
   18:   (General assent). 'Dr. Samuel Ferguson, one of her most glorious sons, will
   19:   not reflect discredit on his origin.' ('No, indeed!' from all parts of the
   20:   hall.)
   21:   
   22:   'This attempt, should it succeed' ('It will succeed ! '), 'will complete and
   23:   link together the notions, as yet disjointed, which the world entertains of
   24:   African cartology' (vehement applause); 'and, should it fail, it will, at
   25:   least, remain on record as one of the most daring conceptions of human
   26:   genius!' (Tremendous cheering.)
   27:   
   28:   'Huzza! Huzza!' shouted the immense audience, completely electrified by
   29:   these inspiring words.
   30:   
   31:   'Huzza for the intrepid Ferguson!' cried one of the most excitable of the
   32:   enthusiastic crowd.
   33:   
   34:   The wildest cheering resounded on all sides; the name of Ferguson was in
   35:   every mouth, and we may safely believe that it lost nothing in passing
   36:   through English throats. Indeed, the hall fairly shook with it.
   37:   
   38:   And there were present, also, those fearless travellers and explorers whose
   39:   energetic temperaments had borne them through every quarter of the globe,
   40:   many of them rowii old and worn out in the service of science. All had, in
   41:   some degree, physically or morally, undergone the sorest trials. They had
   42:   escaped shipwreck; conflagration ; Indian tomahawks and war-clubs; the fagot
   43:   and the stake; nay, even the cannibal maws of the South Sea Islanders.
   44:   
   45:   But still their hearts beat high during Sir Francis M's address, which
   46:   certainly was the finest oratorical success that the Royal Geographical
   47:   Society of London had yet achieved.
   48:   
   49:   But, in England, enthusiasm does not stop short with mere words. It strikes
   50:   off money faster than the dies of the Royal Mint itself. So a subscription
   51:   to encourage Dr. Ferguson was voted there and then, and it at once attained
   52:   the handsome amount of two thousand five hundred pounds. The sum was made
   53:   commensurate with the importance of the enterprise.
   54:   
   55:   A member of the Society then inquired of the president whether Dr. Ferguson
   56:   was not to be officially introduced.
   57:   
   58:   'The doctor is at the disposition of the meeting', replied Sir Francis.
   59:   
   60:   'Let him come in, then! Bring him in!' shouted the audience. 'We'd like to
   61:   see a man of such extraordinary daring, face to face!'
   62:   
   63:   'Perhaps this incredible proposition of his is only intended to mystify us',
   64:   growled an apoplectic old ad miral.
   65:   
   66:   'Suppose that there should turn out to be no such person as Dr. Ferguson?'
   67:   exclaimed another voice, with a malicious twang.
   68:   
   69:   'Why, then, we'd have to invent one!' replied a facetious member of the
   70:   grave Society.
   71:   
   72:   'Ask Dr. Ferguson to come in', was the quiet remark of Sir Francis M.
   73:   
   74:   And come in the doctor did, and stood there, quite unmoved by the thunders
   75:   of applause that greeted his appearance.
   76:   
   77:   He was a man of about forty years of age, of medium height and physique. His
   78:   sanguine temperament was disclosed in the deep color of his cheeks. His
   79:   countenance was coldly expressive, with regular features, and a large nose
   80:   one of those .noses that resemble the prow of a ship, and stamp the faces of
   81:   men predestined to accomplish great discoveries. His eyes, which were gentle
   82:   and intelligent, rather than bold, lent a peculiar charm to his physiognomy.
   83:   His arms were long, and his feet were planted with that solidity which
   84:   indicates a great pedestrian.
   85:   
   86:   A calm gravity seemed to surround the doctor's entire person, and no one
   87:   would dream that he could become the agent of any mystification, however
   88:   harmless.
   89:   
   90:   Hence, the applause that greeted him at the outset continued until he, with
   91:   a friendly gesture, claimed silence on his own behalf. He stepped toward the
   92:   seat that had been prepared for him on his presentation, and then, standing
   93:   erect and motionless, be, with a determined glance, pointed his right
   94:   forefinger upward, and pronounced aloud the single word:
   95:   
   96:   'Excelsior !'
   97:   
   98:   Never had one of Blight's or Cobden's sudden onslaughts, never had one of
   99:   Palmerston's abrupt demands for funds to plate the rucks of the English
  100:   coast with iron, made such a sensation. Sir Francis M's address was
  101:   completely overshadowed. The doctor had shown himself moderate, sublime, and
  102:   self-contained, in one; he had uttered the word of the situation
  103:   
  104:   'Excelsior !'
  105:   
  106:   The gouty old admiral who had been finding fault, was completely won over by
  107:   the singular man before him, and immediately moved the insertion of Dr.
  108:   Ferguson's speech in 'The Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of
  109:   London.'
