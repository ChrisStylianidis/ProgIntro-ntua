    5:   
    6:   TO THE red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains
    7:   came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and
    8:   recrosscd the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and
    9:   scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads so that the
   10:   gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green
   11:   cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale and the clouds that had
   12:   hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The sun flared
   13:   down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along
   14:   the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went away, and in a
   15:   while they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker green to protect
   16:   themselves, and they did not spread any more. The surface of the earth
   17:   crusted, a thin hard crust, and as the sky became pale, so the earth became
   18:   pale, pink in the red country and white in the gray country.
   19:   
   20:   In the water-cut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams.
   21:   Gophers and ant lions started small avalanches. And as the sharp ^un struck
   22:   day after day, the leaves of the young corn hjcame less stiff and erect;
   23:   they bent in a curve at first, and then, as the central ribs of strength
   24:   grew weak, each leaf tilted downward. Then it was June, and the sun shone,
   25:   more fiercely. The brown lines on the corn leaves wid ed and moved in on the
   26:   central ribs. The weeds frayed and edged back toward their roots. The air
   27:   was thin and the sky more pale; and every day the earth paled.
   28:   
   29:   In the roads where the teams moved, where the wheels milled the ground and
   30:   the hooves of the horses beat the ground, the dirt crust broke and the dust
   31:   formed. Every moving thing lifted the dust into the air: a walking man
   32:   lifted a thin layer as high as his waist, and a wagon lifted the dust as
   33:   high as the fence tops, and an automobile boiled a cloud behind it. The dust
   34:   was long in settling back again.
   35:   
   36:   When June was half gone, the big clouds moved up out of Texas and the Gulf,
   37:   high heavy clouds, rain-heads. The men in the fields looked up at the clouds
   38:   and sniffed at them and held wet fingers up to sense the wind. And the
   39:   horses were nervous while the clouds were up. The rain-heads dropped a
   40:   little spattering and hurried on to some other country. Behind them the sky
   41:   was pale again and the sun flared. In the dust there were drop craters where
   42:   the rain had fallen, and there were clean splashes on the corn, and that was
   43:   all.
   44:   
   45:   A gentle wind followed the rain clouds, driving them on northward, a wind
   46:   that softly clashed the drying corn. A day went by and the wind increased,
   47:   steady, unbroken by gusts. The dust from the roads fluffed up and spread out
   48:   and fell on the weeds beside the fields, and fell into the fields a little
   49:   way. Now the wind grew strong and hard and it worked at the rain crust in
   50:   the corn fields. Little by little the sky was darkened by the mixing dust,
   51:   and the wind felt over the earth, loosened the dust, and carried it aw#y.
   52:   The wind grew stronger. The rain crust broke and the dust lifted up out of
   53:   the fields and drove gray plumes into the air like slug'gish smoke. The corn
   54:   threshed the wind and made a dry, rushing sound. The finest dust did not
   55:   settle back to earth now, but disappeared into the darkening sky.
   56:   
   57:   The wind grew stronger, whisked under stones, carried up straws and old
   58:   leaves, and even little clods, marking its course as it sailed across the
   59:   fields. The air and the sky dark'ened and through them the sun shone redly,
   60:   and there was a raw sting in the air. During a night the wind raced faster
   61:   over the land, dug cunningly among the rootlets of the corn, and the corn
   62:   fought the wind with its weakened leaves until the roots were freed by the
   63:   prying wind and then each stalk settled wearily sideways toward the earth
   64:   and pointed the direction of the wind.
   65:   
   66:   The dawn came, but no day. In the gray sky a red sun appeared, a dim red
   67:   circle that gave a little light, like dusk; and as that day advanced, the
   68:   dusk slipped back toward darkness, and the wind cried and whimpered over the
   69:   fallen corn.
   70:   
   71:   Men and women huddled in their houses, and they tied handkerchiefs over
   72:   their noses when they went out, and wore goggles to protect their eyes.
   73:   
   74:   When the night came again it was black night, for the stars could not pierce
   75:   the dust to get down, and the window lights could not even spread beyond
   76:   their own yards. Now the dust was evenly mixed with the air, an emulsion of
   77:   dust and air. Houses were shut tight, and cloth wedged around doors and
   78:   windows, but the dust came in so thinly that it could not be seen in the
   79:   air, and it settled like pollen on the chairs and tables, on the dishes. The
   80:   people brushed it from their shoulders. Little lines of dust lay at the door
   81:   sills.
   82:   
   83:   In the middle of that night the wind passed on and left the land quiet. The
   84:   dust-filled air muffled sound more completely than fog does. The people,
   85:   lying in their beds, heard the wind stop. They awakened when the rushing
   86:   wind was gone. They lay quietly and listened deep into the stillness. Then
   87:   the roosters crowed, and their voices were muffled, and the people stirred
   88:   restlessly in their beds and wanted the morning. They knew it would take a
   89:   long time for the dust to settle out of the air. In the morning the dust
   90:   hung like fog, and the sun was as red as ripe new blood. All day the dust
   91:   sifted down from the sky, and the next day it sifted down. An even blanket
   92:   covered the earth. It settled on the corn, piled up on the tops of the fence
   93:   posts, piled up on the wires; it settled on roofs, blanketed the weeds and
   94:   trees. The people came out of their houses and smelled the hot stinging air
   95:   and covered their noses from it. And the children came out of the houses,
   96:   but they did not run or shout as they would have done after a rain. Men
   97:   stood by their fences and looked at the ruined corn, drying fast now, only a
   98:   little green showing through the film of dust. The men were silent and they
   99:   did not move often. And the women came out of the houses to stand beside
  100:   their men to feel whether this time the men would break. The women studied
  101:   the men's faces secretly, for the corn could go, as long as something else
  102:   remained. The children stood near by, drawing figures in the dust with bare
  103:   toes, and the children sent exploring senses out to see whether men and
  104:   women would break. The children peeked at the faces of the men and women,
  105:   and then drew careful lines in the dust with their toes. Horses came to the
  106:   watering troughs and nuzzled the water to clear the surface dust. After a
  107:   while the faces of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became
  108:   hard and angry and resistant. Then the women knew that they were safe and
  109:   that there was no break. Then they asked, What'll we do?
