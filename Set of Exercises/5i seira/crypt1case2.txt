    2:   Waiting For The Barbarians by Constantine P. Cavafy
    3:   
    4:   What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?
    5:   
    6:   The barbarians are due here today.
    7:   
    8:   Why isn't anything happening in the senate?
    9:   Why do the senators sit there without legislating?
   10:   
   11:   Because the barbarians are coming today.
   12:   What laws can the senators make now?
   13:   Once the barbarians are here, they'll do the legislating.
   14:   
   15:   Why did our emperor get up so early,
   16:   and why is he sitting at the city's main gate
   17:   on his throne, in state, wearing the crown?
   18:   
   19:   Because the barbarians are coming today
   20:   and the emperor is waiting to receive their leader.
   21:   He has even prepared a scroll to give him,
   22:   replete with titles, with imposing names.
   23:   
   24:   Why have our two consuls and praetors come out today
   25:   wearing their embroidered, their scarlet togas?
   26:   Why have they put on bracelets with so many amethysts,
   27:   and rings sparkling with magnificent emeralds?
   28:   Why are they carrying elegant canes
   29:   beautifully worked in silver and gold?
   30:   
   31:   Because the barbarians are coming today
   32:   and things like that dazzle the barbarians.
   33:   
   34:   Why don't our distinguished orators come forward as usual
   35:   to make their speeches, say what they have to say?
   36:   
   37:   Because the barbarians are coming today
   38:   and they're bored by rhetoric and public speaking.
   39:   
   40:   Why this sudden restlessness, this confusion?
   41:   (How serious people's faces have become.)
   42:   Why are the streets and squares emptying so rapidly,
   43:   everyone going home so lost in thought?
   44:   
   45:   Because night has fallen and the barbarians have not come.
   46:   And some who have just returned from the border say
   47:   there are no barbarians any longer.
   48:   
   49:   And now, what's going to happen to us without barbarians?
   50:   They were, those people, a kind of solution.
